Beautiful is better than ugly.          优美胜于丑陋
Explicit is better than implicit.       明了胜于晦涩
Simple is better than complex.          简单胜于复杂    
Complex is better than complicated.     复杂胜于杂乱
Flat is better than nested.             扁平胜于嵌套
Sparse is better than dense.            间隔胜于紧凑
Readability counts.                     可读性很重要      
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.     特别的案例不足以打破规则
Although practicality beats purity.                         尽管实用性胜过纯洁性    
Errors should never pass silently.                      不能忽视任何错误
Unless explicitly silenced.                             除非你一定要这么做
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.             面对不明确的定义，不要尝试去猜测
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.   应该找到一种最好的唯一的方法去解决它
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.      虽然一开始的时候并不是那么明显，因为你不是我（python之父）
Now is better than never.                                               做过好过不做
Although never is often better than *right* now.                        但是不假思索就动手还不如不做
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.              如果你无法很难向人描述方案，这就是个坏点子
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.        如果你很简单的跟别人描述这个方案，那就是好点子
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!        命名空间是个很好的想法，利用它做的更多
